### Alejandro Alonso
Iâ€™m a rising senior at the University of Chicago majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Astrophysics & Astronomy. Iâ€™ve worked on trading analytics and ops-tech tooling within Morgan Stanley's Fixed Income Tech and Institutional Securities Tech Management Divisions, participated as a JSIP SWE fellow at Jane Street, and am currently architecting org-wide platforms as CTO of Paragon Global Investments. Additionally, I co-founded East Edge Securities, a Chicago-based multi-strategy fund that operated for ~2 years, founded and lead recruitment for BlackGen Capitalâ€™s UChicago chapter, and have served in various executive board roles throughout my community's organizations. Born and raised in New York City, I'm a big fan of soccer, poker, and mixing electronic music.

### Personal Projects (T3)
#### Options Pricing for European, American, and Asian Options - https://global-options-pricing.streamlit.app
Implemented traditional Black Scholes, Binomial Tree, and Monte Carlo pricing methods in an object-oriented fashion and built a deep q-network using an OpenAI gym and TF-Agents. Wrote a web app to price live and custom options using Polygon.io and YF.
#### Soccer Outcome Prediction Bot - https://sop-bot.streamlit.app/
Designed a TensorFlow/Keras deep neural network, which reached 71.34% test accuracy with minimal overfitting (with seeded
weights) displayed on a web app. Built data scraping/aggregation/normalization utils to parse and regularize live soccer data.
#### Web-Based Project Feedback Forum - https://github.com/aaworks/project-smithy (previously hosted at projectsmithy.com)
Led a 4-student team to create a web app, database system, and admin dashboard using Python, Flask, SQLite, JS, Bootstrap, and bcrypt password hashing to facilitate project display & feedback. Made for use by a high school class with ~50 students per year.
