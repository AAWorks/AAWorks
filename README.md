### Hi there, I'm Alejandro ðŸ‘‹
I'm enthusiastic about the interconnection of computer science, data engineering, and statistics, and their potential to abstractify complex problems and positively impact our world. I'm always in search of opportunities to expand my knowledge, skills, and growth as a leader with the aim of being a constructive force for both myself and those around me.
