### Alejandro Alonso
Iâ€™m a senior at the University of Chicago majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Astrophysics & Astronomy, and will be joining Palantir Technologies as an FDSE this July. Iâ€™ve worked on trading analytics and ops-tech tooling within Morgan Stanley's Fixed Income Tech and Institutional Securities Tech Management Divisions, participated as a JSIP SWE fellow at Jane Street, and am currently architecting org-wide platforms as CTO of Paragon Global Investments. Additionally, I co-founded East Edge Securities, a Chicago-based multi-strategy fund that operated for ~2 years with an average annualized return of ~28%, founded and lead recruitment for BlackGen Capitalâ€™s UChicago chapter, and have served in various executive board roles throughout my community's organizations. Born and raised in New York City, I'm a big fan of soccer, poker, and EDM.
